## Part A: existing technology
* Tech
  * [SkySafari7](https://skysafariastronomy.com/)
  * A app about star gazing
  * finds events such as solar eclipse,lunar phases, planetary occultations and etc.
  * Mobile App(Phone)
  * [MESA](https://mesastar.org/)
  * Helps run simulated experiments
  * Great for collecting data for astrophysics students
  * Great educational app/simulation.
  * Runs on any hardware, simulation/app website
  * [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69815-astronomy-astrophysics-toolbox-for-matlab-maat)
  * Good for astrophysics analyis
  * good for experimental simulation
  * Runs on any hardware, simulation/app website
  * [Stellarium](https://stellarium.org/)
  * Software that helps users stargaze, it's like a binoculars or a telescope but with the naked eye
  * Requires a computer
  * Minimal:Windows 7 and above; macOS 10.13 and above
  * In general a great software for astrophysics
## Part B: possible future technology
* Idea
  * Detail
