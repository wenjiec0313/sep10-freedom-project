## Part A: existing technology
* Tech
  * [SkySafari7](https://skysafariastronomy.com/)
  * A app about star gazing
  * finds events such as solar eclipse,lunar phases, planetary occultations and etc.
  * Mobile App(Phone)
  * [MESA](https://mesastar.org/)
  * Helps run simulated experiments
  * Great for collecting data for astrophysics students
  * Great educational app/simulation.
  * Runs on any hardware, simulation/app website
  * [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69815-astronomy-astrophysics-toolbox-for-matlab-maat)
  * Good for astrophysics analyis
  * good for experimental simulation
  * Runs on any hardware, simulation/app website
  * [Stellarium](https://stellarium.org/)
  * Software that helps users stargaze, it's like a binoculars or a telescope but with the naked eye
  * Requires a computer
  * Minimal:Windows 7 and above; macOS 10.13 and above
  * In general a great software for astrophysics
* Hardware/Devices used by astrophysicists
  * Telescopes
  * There's ground-based telescope used to observe stars and light that are visible on earth using a telescope
  * There are also space-based telescopes where they're located on a space craft, helping us discover more about outer space
  * There are Radio telescope to  detect radio waves from celestial objects
  * All of the telescope are great ways fro us to discover and detect things(radio waves, stars, light)
  * There's also the gravitional wave detector that measures tiny ripple in spacetime
  * There's also Neutrino detectors that captures elusive subatomic particles from space
  * Spectrometers that analyze the light from stars and galaxies to determine their composition  and other propties
  * Space probes, Robotic  spacecraft that are sent to study celestial bodies up close
  * These space probes can be great hardware for us to get a first impression of this celestial bodies, safe or not? and etc
  * There are also supporting hardwares such as:
  * Supercomputers, this serves as a data stroage and can help simulate complext simulations to test certain tests.
  * Adaptive Optics, a system used for the ground-based telescope to correct atmosphere blurring
  * CCD cameras and filters used with telescopes to capture and record images of celestial body.
  * Interferometers:Arrays of telescope or radio dishes that work together to produce higher-resoultion images than a single instrument could achieve
  * Bolometer, They are used in microwave and radio astronomy, these detectors measure the energy of incoming photons by registering how much they warm a superconducting material.
  * X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes Because Earth's atmosphere blocks these high-energy wavelengths, these telescopes are launched into space. The Chandra X-ray Observatory is a prime example.
  * These telescopes help observe X-ray and Gamma rays as earth's atmosphere blockes these high-energy wavelengths preventing us from observing and learning more about them

## Part B: possible future technology
* Idea
  * Detail
