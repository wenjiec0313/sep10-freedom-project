While searching for hardware and software for my topic "AstroPhysics",I found many interesting apps that can help astrophysicist such as [SkySafari7](https://skysafariastronomy.com/), this app is a mobile phone that's about star-gazing helping astrophysicists find events such as solar eclipse,lunar phases,plaentary,occultations and etc,an additional app i found was  [MESA](https://mesastar.org/), a app for  running simulated experiments,collecting data for astrophysicists/students,great educational app that runs on any hareware,simulation or app website, Another App I found was [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69815-astronomy-astrophysics-toolbox-for-matlab-maat) It helps students and astrophysicist with astrophysics analysis, experimental simulation, runs on any hardware, it's a simulation/app website
