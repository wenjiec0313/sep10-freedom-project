# Researching for Part 1
While searching for hardware and software for my topic "AstroPhysics",I found many interesting apps that can help astrophysicist such as [SkySafari7](https://skysafariastronomy.com/), this app is a mobile phone that's about star-gazing helping astrophysicists find events such as solar eclipse,lunar phases,plaentary,occultations and etc,an additional app I found was  [MESA](https://mesastar.org/), a app for  running simulated experiments,collecting data for astrophysicists/students,great educational app that runs on any hareware,simulation or app website, Another App I found was [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69815-astronomy-astrophysics-toolbox-for-matlab-maat) It helps students and astrophysicist with astrophysics analysis, experimental simulation, runs on any hardware, it's a simulation/app website, Lastly I found [Stellarium](https://stellarium.org/) another stargazing app,requires a computer

# EDP
I feel like I'm on step 2 or 3(Research the problem/Brainstorm solutions), either still researching the problem or ready to move on and start brainstorming about more future technologies for my selected subjects, but I'm still quite unsure and would need a little more research so I lean towards step 2,research is still needed so I can find issues so I can use these ideas to enhance my thinking for future possible technologies that could help people within this subject(Astrophysics)
# Skills
I learnt many skills during Researching for Part 1 Some are:

### How to read
It's extremely important to read and analyze these apps carefully to make sure they are relevant to the topic that your searching about or you'll end up with information that seems useless but aren't, skimming would also work but you can miss small details,let's say you're researching ktichen technology but slowly the topic begins to shift into a different topic, that's a sign to move on, so you don't collect the wrong information needed for your project.
