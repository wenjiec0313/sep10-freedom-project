#  SEP 10 Freedom Project

# Deciding my topic for the project
The topic I decided on is Astrophysics because I love learning about astrology and passive for physics, so I decided to merge these two passions together into one, I believe it would be pretty easy to incorporate technology in this topic,I had considered cooking too but ultimately wanted to do this instead, and I did some research for cooking beforehand [Best Kitchen Techonologies](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-smart-kitchen-appliances) and [Impact Of Technology On Cooking](https://daxcooke.net/culinary-evolution-the-impact-of-technology-on-food-preparation/)These articles were fun to look at and quite informative,but this one website convinced me to do Astrophysics instead as it would be wonderful to incorporate technology as It could help answer some unanswered questions in the topic of Astrophysics [NASA Astrophysics](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/) The thought of finding a solution to unanswered questions amazes me.

# EDP
Currently I'm on step 1(define the problem) and step 2(research the problem) of the EDP(engineering design process)as this is just the mere beginning of my project and we just finished on finding what we're passionate about, now we're taking a deeper dive on that topic, and researching about this topic's technology "Space and ground telescope, detectors and AI used for data storage"I'll be stuck on step 2 for a good while to brainstorm ideas for my freedom project
# Skills 
### How to Search/Google
One skill that I learned during this experience is _How to search for specifc info_,I'm saying this because in order to succeed in this project, you'll need to find specific info that you need, we know everything in the article/text may be cool and stuff but they aren't always needed and something the entire article may not even connect to your project, so adding a specific word helped me find the specific info that i needed, instead of searching "Astrophysics" search "Astrophysics technology" or "Instruments of Astrophysics"With a few added words it narrows down the info into ones you needed but still be aware, not all info are needed, connecting to my next part of skills
### How to analyze/skim text or articles
Another skill that I learned during this expierence is _How to analyze texts_ this skill is important as it helps sort out the needed and the unnecessary info, this helps save time,and finding the right info that fits your idea will greatly impact the structure and outcome of your project,tips/note to self on how to analyze quickly use ctrl + f/ cmd + f to find key words that connect to the project "technology" so ctrl+f/cmd+f and then type "technology"

# Summary
Generally, I'm really excited to learn web design and get to create a website for my passion, researching websites about my passion and designing/styling the looks of my website.
