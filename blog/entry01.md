#  SEP 10 Freedom Project

# Deciding my topic for the project
The topic I decided on is Astrophysics because I love learning about astrology and passive for physics, so I decided to merge these two passions together into one, I believe it would be pretty easy to incorporate technology in this topic,I had considered cooking too but ultimately wanted to do this instead, and I did some research for cooking beforehand [Best Kitchen Techonologies](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-smart-kitchen-appliances) and [Impact Of Technology On Cooking](https://daxcooke.net/culinary-evolution-the-impact-of-technology-on-food-preparation/)These articles were fun to look at and quite informative,but this one website convinced me to do Astrophysics instead as it would be wonderful to incorporate technology as It could help answer some unanswered questions in the topic of Astrophysics [NASA Astrophysics](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/) The thought of finding a solution to unanswered questions amazes me.

# EDP
Currently I'm on step 1(define the problem) and step 2(research the problem) of the EDP(engineering design process)as this is just the mere beginning of my project and we just finished on finding what we're passionate about, now we're taking a deeper dive on that topic, and researching about this topic, I'll be stuck on step 2 for a good while to brainstorm ideas for my freedom project
