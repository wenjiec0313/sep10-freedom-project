# Context
I brainstormed part B ideas by making already existing techonologies better, one example of this is my idea of a "all in one" telescope, a telescope with the functions of infrared, radio, and gamma telescope in one,I finalized my content to make it suitable for my project by arranging from how complex they are, starting from least complex to most complext and I added additional information if I felt like what I had wasn't enough, for example I was told I didn't have images so I found  [image1](https://spacearcade.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/030A9952-copy-scaled.jpg) and   [image2](https://media.wired.com/photos/59326efe9be5e55af6c24e08/master/pass/rsz_1gordon_med1.jpg)
